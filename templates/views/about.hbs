        <p>Are we friends? Or are we foes? That kind of thing you decide yourselves!<br>
            I love heroes, but I donâ€™t want to be one. Do you even know what a hero is!? <br>
            For example, you have some meat. <br>
            Pirates will feast on the meat, but the hero will distribute it among the people! <br>
            I want to eat meat!
